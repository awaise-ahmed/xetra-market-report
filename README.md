# xetra-market-report
This project demonstrates the use of Pandas with Python to create an ETL process by extracting Xetra stock market data from a source AWS S3 bucket, transforming it to generate the required analytical report, and then load it onto a target S3 bucket in parquet format for further processing.

The code is written using OOP principles, and is ready to be production deployed.
